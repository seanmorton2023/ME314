based on interpretation of the problem notes, way to do the problem is
- cannot solve for t = __ during the solving for theta at a given point
	in time bc theta and thetad depend on t
- modify RK4 to take a dependence on t as well, like in HW1
	- simulate(), integrate(), and dxdt() need to pass t to rk4 as well
	- already have the framework for this 
- use the solve_constrained_EL() equation and modify:
	- modify so we can combine with a matrix of forcing
	- make a new dummy variable t_i that uses the current point
		in time for computing forcing
