Dad's advice on simplifying code execution:
- look at ways to make the code example smaller
- Linux has functions called Ptrace() and Strace() that are
	able to step through what's happening in each process - 
	could see if I could track execution like that
- each function call adds to the stack, so each function call
	adds additional time
- user documentation for the library functions is key
