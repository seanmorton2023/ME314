start with 4 states, x, theta, xd, thetad

when you apply constraint, lose 1
when you apply conserved energy, lose 1
when you apply conserved momentum, lose 1

at the end you can describe whole system with 1 
variable evolving in time

with 4 equations to describe system, can break it down
to constraint phi, hamiltonian h, momentum p, angle theta

time derivatives of phi = 0, hamiltonian = 0, momentum = 0,
theta is some crazy ODE

can get rid of independent states in exchange for 
having unintuitive ODEs


____

1. assumptions about conserved quantity via Noether relate to
	the derivative of the Lagrangian
2. physical intuition is about global invariance; we care 
	about the local invariance, which can be evaluated by taking
	the derivative of the global invariance and evaluating at
	eps = 0
