ME314 quiz practice

thing he emphasized about eigenvalues and eigenvectors:
- eigenvectors are the vectors that a matrix A (that they belong to)
	only scales
- when computing a matrix multiplation x = A*b, 
	any vector b can be decomposed into a linear combination
	of A's eigenvectors, C1*v1 + C2*v2 + .... To find A*b, can 
	use how A acts on the individual eigenvectors, and use
	x = C1*lambda1*v1 + C2*lambda2*v2
- solutions to first order ODEs can be written as C1*exp(lambda1*v1)
	+ C2*exp(lambda2*v2) + ... or something. look it up in notes
		- was less emphasized than the first 2 points
- he didn't like just thinking of eigenvalues as the values such that 
	det(lambda*I-A) = 0 but it may be practical to know
	
	
Other notes
- determinant of a matrix det(A) = lambda1 * lambda2 * ... * lambda_n
- 2x2 matrix has 2 eigenvalues, can be found using the det(A-lambda*I) method.
	determinant yields a quadratic equation which has 2 roots, which are the 2 polys
- matrix has as many eigenvectors as it has eigenvalues. Find eigenvectors
		by subbing in each eigenvalue in A*v = lambda*v equation, then
		finding values of (x1, x2) in v that work with the rows of 
		the resulting matrix from A - lambda*I
- eigenvectors for a matrix are not unique, but the ratio of their
	elements are unique. for example both (1,-1) and (3,-3) could be
	eigenvectors of a system

has good practice for checking if vectors are eigenvalues of a matrix,
but also practicing finding eigenvalues
