General
Import:
- compute_EL
- solve_EL
- solve_constrained_EL

don't import rk4 and simulate; we can just use
integrate() and simulate() provided


Take 2hrs to start, chug through, and hopefully get through the first 4 problems



P1
- define variables and constants
- define x and y as a function of theta
- make a substitution dict
- define KE, U, and lagrangian of system
- compute non-constrained EL
- solve
- make dxdt function
- simulate system over time

validation
- plot hamiltonian of system over time
- no conserved quantity for single pendulum

P2
- use setup provided in problem 1

solving what happens at time of impact
- make the equations L and Phi, and differentiate
- define the equations in terms of L, q, and qd in Sympy
- don't solve the equations yet; just compute the form of them

P3

- this is where we solve the equations from tau- to tau+
- sub in dummy variables for the functions q(t)and qd(t)
- find solutions to qdot and lambda
	- filter the solutions so that only the ones where lambda is
		nonzero are valid
- 

P4

- define phi at initial timestep
- define impact condition phi as point where theta equals zero
- calculate 
- define impact update function
- construct general loop structure of checking whether an impact
	has occurred


P5
- only start once first impact problem has been approached
