Plans for ME314 project

Concept: Clacker balls with external forcing
- Controlled by user input in a GUI
- spring/damper force pulls center of pendulum from the
	initial position to the position user commands
	
	
Steps in process to consider:
on every frame:
- draw frame
- calculate user position
- calculate motion of particle
- update motion of particle according to forced Euler-
	Lagrange equations
- check for impacts of each box


Functions needed for the assignment:
- GUI drawing
- calculate Euler Lagrange
- Impact condition matrix (16 of em)
- Impact update
- Rotational and linear inertia calculations


GUIs with mouse motion event handlers:
- PyAutoGui
- Tkinter
- Matplotlib
- PyQT5
- Pygame (not a very professional choice)
- PySide 2
- Kivy
- WxPython

GUIs without motion event handlers:
- Plotly - buggy and slow
- Seaborn - uses Matplotlib mouse motion


Default first to libraries I know. Default next to things
I want to get better at. In all cases consider what looks good and
is fast.
