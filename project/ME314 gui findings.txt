GUIs with mouse motion event handlers:
- PyAutoGui
- Tkinter
- Matplotlib
- PyQT5
	- uses backend of either Matplotlib or PyQTGraph. PyQTGraph
		seems limited compared to the capabilities of Matplotlib.
- Pygame (not a very professional choice)
	- moreover: uses things like Tkinter in its backend
- PySide 2
- Kivy
	- seems useful for creating web apps, but the plotting 
		backend uses numpy and matplotlib
- WxPython

GUIs without motion event handlers:
- Plotly - buggy and slow
- Seaborn - uses Matplotlib mouse motion


Current decision re/ GUI drawing:
- doesn't seem to be a very good method of plotting points 
	interactively with the base capabilities of Matplotlib. three options:
		- use advanced Matplotlib; modify canvas.draw() so that interval
			is faster than the current 10fps
		- use the matplotlib Animation() capabilities: FuncAnimation
			and ArtistAnimation()
		- just use Tkinter to plot points, lines, options 



Default first to libraries I know. Default next to things
I want to get better at. In all cases consider what looks good and
is fast.


Animation findings
- There are 2 methods to do frame animation:
	- window.update() (or root.update() I think) and time.sleep()
	- create a Timer object, and onTimer, do an update
		- I like this b/c it uses the concept of interrupts rather
			than sleeping after a prev. code portion of unknown time
